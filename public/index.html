        <p>Welcome to the Smart Garden Project, a pioneering initiative that merges advanced technology with the nurturing of nature.</p>
        <p>This document serves as a guide to the structure and expectations of our development team as we embark on creating a fully automated smart garden within our campus greenhouse.</p>
        <p>The Pride PlantLab is an automated sustainable community garden that will be located in the green house on the top of Thelma Ryan Hall.</p>
        <p>This will be a place for undergraduate students to come and learn about data analytics, sustainable/smart agriculture, and technology.</p>
        <p>Students from surrounding high schools and middle schools will be invited to participate in the community garden and learn about IoT in sustainable agriculture.</p>
        <ol>The end goal of this project is threefold: <br>
            <br><li>To establish a fully functioning and sustainable food-growing operation in the greenhouse at the top of Thelma Ryan Hall, monitored and maintained by computer science, biology, and sociology students with interests in food or environmental sociology.</li>
            <br><li>To incorporate technology that utilizes smart IoT systems powered with data analytics capabilities and machine learning.</li>
            <br><li>to invite schools from the Hammond area and around the state to visit the project, sparking interest in pursuing degrees in biology, computer science, and sociology at southeastern.</li>
